 * This is a wrapper class for a peerjs connection. It gracefully handles making the connection,
 * reopening the connection when it drops, saving and loading connection state, and reliably transferring
 * data over the connection.
 *
 * peer - The Peer object representing our client
 * dstId - The peer id we want to connect with
 * dataCallback - This function is passed any data that the connection receives
 * connectionCallback - This function is called whenever the connection status changes. It is passed true
 *      if the connection is open and false otherwise
 * conn - Optional. This is a peerjs DataConnection object. If included, the MaqawConnection will use it
 *      instead of creating a new one.
